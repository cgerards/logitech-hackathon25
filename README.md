## Actionly – AI Agent for the MX Master Action Wheel

Actionly brings intelligent task automation directly to the Logitech MX Master Action Wheel. Our goal is to make AI-powered workflows accessible - not just for power-users, but for everyone.

## 🚀 Inspiration

We wanted to create an easy, intuitive way for everyday users to benefit from AI automation. The MX Master series offers a perfect foundation: widely adopted, high-quality, and built for productivity. By integrating an AI Agent directly into the Action Wheel, we enable users to trigger intelligent task-solving with a simple gesture.

## ✨ What It Does

- Actionly allows users to activate an AI Agent that performs dynamic tasks across desktop applications.
Examples include:

- Creating Outlook appointments from a list of events

- Executing multi-step workflows in Microsoft Excel

- Performing repetitive or tedious tasks via automated keyboard shortcuts

- The Agent interprets user intent and executes the necessary sequence of actions—quickly and consistently.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- Developed using the Logitech SDK in C#

- UI implemented with a lightweight XAML/XAML.cs pop-up window

- Built a dynamic system that:

- Understands user commands

- Maps them to application-specific workflows

- Executes tasks using contextual keyboard-shortcut logic

- This modular structure allows Actionly to work across different programs with minimal configuration.
